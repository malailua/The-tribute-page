								David Attenborough (1926 – ) is one of the most widely respected
								TV broadcasters and has become known as the face and voice of
								natural history documentaries. His career in broadcasting has
								stretched over more than a half a century from 1952. David is
								the younger brother of actor, Richard Attenborough.
							</p>

							<p>
								David was brought up in Leicester and went to Clare College,
								Cambridge to study Natural Sciences; after graduating in 1947,
								he was called up for two years national service in the Navy.
							</p>

							<p>
								On leaving the navy, he briefly worked as an editor for a
								children’s book for a publishing company. However, in 1950 he
								applied to the BBC for a job. Initially, he was rejected, but
								his CV remained on file and shortly afterwards was given a three
								months training schedule to work as a BBC broadcaster. He proved
								to be a good worker and quickly progressed through the ranks of
								fledgeling BBC TV service. He became in charge of all
								non-fiction broadcasts and was soon associated with various
								natural history programmes such as The Pattern of Animals and
								Zoo Quest.
							</p>

							<p>
								From 1965 to 1969 Attenborough was the controller of BBC2. He
								initiated a wide range of programmes including live
								<em
									>Snooker, Match of the Day, the Likely Lads and
									Mastermind.</em
								>
								David later said he felt BBC2 should maintain a good range of
								diversity.
							</p>

							<p>
								However, David Attenborough is remembered primarily for his
								natural history series that he wrote and produced. These used
								ground breaking filming techniques and his ease of presentation
								made the material very accessible and of interest to a new
								generation of viewers. His major series included:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Life on Earth (1979)</li>
								<li>The Living Planet (1984)</li>
								<li>The Trials of Life (1990)</li>
								<li>Life in the Freezer (about Antarctica; 1993)</li>
								<li>The Private Life of Plants (1995)</li>
								<li>The Life of Birds (1998)</li>
								<li>The Life of Mammals (2002)</li>
								<li>Life in the Undergrowth (2005)</li>
								<li>The Blue Planet (2001)</li>
								<li>The Blue Planet II (2017)</li>
								<li>Seven Worlds One Planet (2019)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								He also narrated
								<em>over 250 programmes of Wildlife on One.</em>
							</p>

							<p>
								The key to David’s appeal is his ability to share his genuine
								enthusiasm and love for wildlife. His distinctive and calming
								voice has become synonymous with wildlife broadcasting.
								Interestingly a reader’s survey of Readers’ Digest found that
								David Attenborough was the most trusted of British celebrities.

							In recent years David has become increasingly outspoken on issues
							such as environmental damage, global warming and extinction of
							particular species. He has stated that human overpopulation and
							global warming (caused by human activity) are the root cause of
							much of the world’s growing environmental problems. He has lent
							his voice to organisations such as <b>WWF</b> in their fight to
							protect certain species and campaign for wildlife. In the last
							episode of “State of the Planet”, he summed up his feelings with
							this statement.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							“The future of life on earth depends on our ability to take
							action. Many individuals are doing what they can, but real success
							can only come if there’s a change in our societies and our
							economics and in our politics. I’ve been lucky in my lifetime to
							see some of the greatest spectacles that the natural world has to
							offer. Surely we have a responsibility to leave for future
							generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species.”
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							In the BBC series <b>Blue Planet II</b>, he narrated the case of
							700 plastic ducks lost at sea in 1992, and which continue to float
							around the world. This played a major role in highlighting the
							influence of plastic pollution in the world and his raising of
							issue, played a role in galvanising a global change in attitudes
							to plastic.
